cmap is a poor-mans version of `nmap`. It utilizes nmap under the hood.

I'm just really fucking lazy learning the proper nmap syntax. Nost of the time, I just wanna know which hosts are up, and if port 22 is open for SSH. So yeah, call me stupid, but I actually use this tool almost on a daily base.
Sorry to all the nmap fans who feel offended by this creation of mine. But hey - at least it uses nmap under the hood, right? ;)

## Usage

```bash
$ cmap scan network 192.168.0.0/24 -p 6443
Starting scan of network [192.168.0.0/24] with Timeout 15m0s

### Multi-Threading

It should be rather called "multi-go-routines". I utilize go-routines with a thread-pool design approach, so you can easily tailor the amount of threads used using the `--paralell` flag.
By default I spawn 10 go routines.

I don't actually multi-thread the network discovery, but only the host-detection part.
That means, if you wanna scan a `/12` network, it first calls `nmap -sn cidr/12` under the hood, which will take forever (or at least it will feel like it's taking forever). However, now that you got a couple hundred (or - imagine - a couple thousand) hosts reported as "online", the thread-pool is used to scan for open ports in paralell. Each thread is scanning one host at a time, using `nmap ipaddr -p 22`.
